# F1 Strategy Analysis Project

## Description
The F1 Strategy Analysis project leverages data and visualization techniques to analyze Formula 1 race strategies. By focusing on key performance metrics such as pit stops, lap times, tire degradation, and race positions, this project aims to provide insights into the decision-making process of F1 teams during a race.

## Key Features
- **Pit Stop Strategies**: Analyzing optimal pit stop timing, tire compounds, and their impact on the race.
- **Lap Time and Race Pace**: Tracking driver performance across the race.
- **Tire Wear and Degradation**: Studying the effect of tire wear on performance.
- **Teammate Comparisons**: Comparing performance between teammates within a team.
- **Position Changes**: Visualizing the movement of drivers throughout the race.
- **Gap to Leader**: Monitoring the time gap between drivers and the leader at various stages.

## Technologies Used
- **Data Extraction**: FastF1 (for race data like lap times, pit stops, telemetry).
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy (for data wrangling and analysis).
- **Visualization**: Plotly (for interactive charts and graphs).
- **Web Framework**: Dash, Flask (for building the interactive web app).
- **Containerization**: Docker (for easy deployment across environments).
- **Version Control & CI/CD**: GitHub Actions (for automated testing and deployment).

## Future Enhancements
- Expand race data analysis with additional seasons and events.
- Integrate real-time race data for live analysis.
- Add more advanced machine learning models to predict strategies.
